# APP MINI PROJECT
## TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
This project aims to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Graphical User Interface
(GUI) in Python. Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
The objective of the game is to get three of the same symbols in a row, column,
or diagonal. The game will be developed using Python's built-in GUI module,
Tkinter.
The project will start by developing the game logic for Tic-Tac-Toe, which will
include functions for determining the winner and checking for valid moves.
Once the game logic is in place, the GUI will be developed using Tkinter. The
GUI will include a 3x3 grid of buttons for the players to make their moves, as
well as a scorekeeper to keep track of the game's progress. The project will also
include unit tests to ensure the game logic functions correctly and the GUI is
responsive and intuitive.
Overall, this project aims to provide a fun and engaging implementation of TicTac-Toe using Python's GUI capabilities, while also demonstrating fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, conditional statements, and functions.
